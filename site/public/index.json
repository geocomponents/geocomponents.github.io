This theme requires Hugo\u0026rsquo;s extended version to support SCSS compilation, so make please sure you install the extended version. For more detailed information and other methods of installation you can visit the Hugo installation guide.\nThere may be other ways to install Hugo that are more applicable for your project. For example, you can use the NPM package hugo-bin to include Hugo in a project that already uses NPM packages.\nChecking your Hugo installation Run the following command in your terminal to check if Hugo is installed. Copy   hugo version    Make sure the version name mentions extended, to indicate you\u0026rsquo;ve installed the extended version of Hugo, which is required for this theme.\nCreating a site Create a new site docs (you may choose any name you want). In your projects root folder, run the following command: Copy   hugo new site docs    This will create a new folder /docs with all required files in it.\nInstalling the theme Download and copy the theme files into /docs/themes/ace-documentation or use git to clone the repository to that directory: Copy   cd docs cd themes git clone https://github.com/vantagedesign/ace-documentation    After theme installation, the /docs/themes/ace-documentation folder should contain the file theme.toml, along with all other theme files.\nConfiguring your hugo site to use the theme Inside your site\u0026rsquo;s folder, /docs, you will find a file called config.toml. This is the configuration file for your site. Open it and configure it to use the Ace theme by setting the following value: Copy   theme = \u0026#34;ace-documentation\u0026#34;    Installing example content You can add some sample content to your site by placing the contents of the exampleSite directory in your /docs directory.\n"

Copy   hugo    Creating content Markdown Pages are written in Markdown and files defining pages should end with .md. For more information on how to use Markdown, search for tutorials on the internet or use this cheatsheet.\nFile structure Ace looks at your file stucture and automatically turns it into a menu. The structure looks as follows: Copy   \" data-lang=\"\" /content ├── _index.md ├── page-top.md └── /level-one ├── _index.md ├── page-1-one.md ├── page-1-two.md └── /level-two ├── _index.md ├── page-2-one.md ├── page-2-two.md └── /level-three ├── _index.md ├── page-3-one.md ├── page-3-two.md └── /level-four ├── page-4-one.md └── page-4-two.md    Your \u0026lsquo;homepage\u0026rsquo; for every level is the _index.md file. Subpages (like page-1-one.md) are automatically added as child pages in the menu.\nAn exception exists for the top level files. /content/_index.md is your homepage, and any other page files in the /content folder are not automatically added in the menu. Instead, they can be accessed manually through their URL (yourdomain.com/page-title).\nFile contents Every file should start by defining the title and weight of the page. This can be done by adding the following text to the top of your page file. Copy   +++ title = \u0026#34;Usage\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; weight = 2 +++    The title will be displayed as a H1 header at the top of your page. The weight determines the order in the menu.\nAfter that you may write the content you desire with Markdown. You may use shortcodes to add some more \u0026lsquo;advanced\u0026rsquo; layout features to the page, such as code hightlighting, a \u0026lsquo;lead\u0026rsquo; style paragraph, images, video\u0026rsquo;s, and more.\nNavigation bar menu While the left sidebar navigation is automatically populated by the file structure described above, and the right \u0026lsquo;table of contents\u0026rsquo; sidebar menu is automatically populated by the headings defined on a page, the top navigation bar needs to be configured manually. This can be done in the config.toml file, by adding the following lines: Copy   [[menu.shortcuts]] name = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;i class=\u0026#39;fab fa-github\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/vantagedesign/ace-documentation\u0026#34; weight = 10    This example will create a GitHub icon that links to that URL.
